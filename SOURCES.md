## Research Notes

### Evaluating Witness Credibility

**Factors supporting credibility**:
- ✅ Multiple independent witnesses (7+)
- ✅ Included children (harder to coordinate hoax)
- ✅ Police confirmed genuine fear
- ✅ No apparent financial motive
- ✅ Consistent story over decades
- ✅ No recantations
- ✅ Witnesses avoided publicity

**Factors requiring consideration**:
- ⚠️ Stressful, dark conditions
- ⚠️ No physical evidence of entities
- ⚠️ Only witnesses saw creatures (not police)
- ⚠️ Extraordinary nature of claims

### Comparing Explanations

**Owl theory strengths**:
- Plausible natural explanation
- Matches some physical characteristics
- Explains timing (nesting season)
- Aggressive owl behavior documented

**Owl theory weaknesses**:
- Witnesses were experienced hunters
- Some description elements don't match
- Behavior seems atypical for owls
- Duration seems long for owl encounter

**Unknown encounter strengths**:
- Credible multiple witnesses
- Consistent testimony
- No satisfactory complete explanation
- Initial UFO sighting

**Unknown encounter weaknesses**:
- No physical evidence
- Extraordinary claim
- Alternative explanations exist
