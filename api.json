      "full": "The Hopkinsville Goblins incident occurred on the night of August 21-22, 1955, at the Sutton farmhouse between Kelly and Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Members of the Sutton and Taylor families (7+ witnesses) reported that small, 3-4 foot tall beings with large eyes, long arms, and silvery/metallic appearance approached the house after a landed craft was observed. The families shot at the creatures multiple times with firearms, but the beings seemed unaffected and continued approaching windows and the roof. The encounter lasted several hours. Police investigation found no physical evidence but witnesses were clearly terrified. The incident remains **unexplained**, with proposed explanations including great horned owls, mass hysteria, or genuine unknown encounter. Witnesses maintained their story for life."
